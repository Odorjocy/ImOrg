This program helps you to organize your pictures. It comes in handy when you have a lot of pictures in a folder and want 
to organize them into subfolders. The idea came after my wedding. I had a lot of pictures in a single folder and wanted 
to share them with my family and friends. I wrote this tiny program to organize the photos into subfolders like Family, 
Friends, Print, etc... I've been learning programming for a while and this is my first working software. After reading 
the code, you can guess that I'm more like a scripter than a programmer. I want to learn and build applications like this.
I would appreciate it if you are an experienced programmer and want to make suggestions.

## Further plans

- General bugfixes
- General refactoring to make the code less "spaghetti"
- I'm planning to replace tKinter with PyQT
- Make the app responsive
- Rework the image resizing
- Make the app object-oriented
- Implementing further features like
  - Saving the session
  - Handling large amounts of pictures

The items are not in implementation order. Because this is just an application for learning the most important 
development will be the object orientation.

## Known issues

- If you clear the session and start a new one right away there will be a lot of malfunctions due to the scratchy cleanup
- You cannot resize the app all the widgets' locations and sizes are hardcoded
- The names of the collections are not validated
- The code is more like a script and hard to maintain
- Typos here and there... 

## Contribution 

I welcome every suggestion or development idea, but I am most interested in design-related suggestions. Through this 
app, I want to learn how to structure object-oriented software. Feel free to let me know your thoughts via email (jozsef.odor@proton.me),
create a pull request, or fork the repo.
