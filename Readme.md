This program helps you to organize your pictures. It comes in handy when you have a lot of pictures in a folder and want 
to organize them into subfolders. The idea came after my wedding. I had a lot of pictures in a single folder and wanted 
to share them with my family and friends. I wrote this tiny program to organize the photos into subfolders like Family, 
Friends, Print, etc... I've been learning programming for a while and this is my first working software. After reading 
the code, you can guess that I'm more like a scripter than a programmer. I want to learn and build applications like this.
I would appreciate it if you are an experienced programmer and want to make suggestions.

## Further plans

- General bugfixes
- General refactoring to make the code less "spaghetti"
- I'm planning to replace tKinter with PyQT - Done
- Make the app responsive - Partialy done
- Rework the image resizing - Done
- Make the app object-oriented - Done, but not perfect
- Implementing further features like
  - Saving the session
  - Handling large amounts of pictures

The items are not in implementation order.

## Known issues

- You can resize the app, but you cannot make it smaller then the current image and the size setting gets evaluated when you change the picture
- The name of the collections are not validated
- Typos here and there... :)

## Contribution 

I welcome every suggestion or idea. Feel free to fork the repo.
